### Beneficial ownership: From ‘no way’ to ‘OK’

This week the Cayman Islands government announced it would make public the true owners of companies incorporated in the islands, as soon as European Union countries establish their own public registers. The anticipated date for legislation is 2022.

Perhaps it’s not a complete 180-degree reversal, but over the past three years Cayman’s stance on the privacy (or publicity) of beneficial ownership information certainly has 'evolved'.

“Cayman really has had no choice in the matter. Once the United Kingdom said we must, then we must,” said one longtime legal professional, who has had much experience in the UK and Cayman. “What is important is that Cayman maintains control over the form of the register and how it is implemented. Any unnecessary obstinance will merely make things more difficult and harm the relationship Cayman has with the UK, and possibly the financial service industry’s reputation.”

However, a senior partner in a small Cayman law firm said that Cayman should fight for its interests at every turn, even against the UK, which the senior partner said has never given Cayman the support it should.

“We cannot continue to surrender at every point. Cayman’s adversaries, including in the UK and Europe, will never be satisfied as long as our financial services industry continues to exist,” the senior partner said.

**Pressure and positioning**

Back in May 2016, the government’s line of the sand could hardly be drawn any more clearly. Premier Alden McLaughlin announced that Cayman would not participate in a beneficial ownership standard unless it was adopted by the United States.

Then-Minister for Financial Services Wayne Panton (a former partner at Walkers) sent a letter to then-UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, stating that Cayman would participate only after “this standard is agreed and adopted by all Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, G-20 and OECD member states”.

Remember, too, that at that time the topic on the table was merely a mechanism for the automatic exchange of beneficial ownership data between law enforcement and tax authorities in 40 participating countries … not the ‘public register’ standard to which Cayman has now assented.

(Nobody’s Nostradamus: Premier McLaughlin said he believed the upcoming UK referendum on Brexit would create “a lull” surrounding the issue.)

To be fair, to say the last three years have been politically uneventful would be an understatement. The ‘Leave’ Brexit vote did happen. British parliamentary leadership has been shuffled twice. And in Cayman, while Premier McLaughlin’s government did retain power, it emerged from the 2017 election in dramatically altered form. 

In 2018, British legislators forced the issue, voting to insert a clause into the UK Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act demanding that if British Overseas Territories did not voluntarily introduce public registers, then an order-in-council would compel them to do so.

British lawmakers cited national security concerns as overriding the devolution of responsibility for financial matters to territories and their parliaments.

The issue of public registers strained relations between the UK and its territories -- along with concerns over British intervention into hot-button social issues such as same-sex marriage and immigration standards.

Like siblings chafing against a parent’s strict household rules, the UK’s display of strong-handedness served to unite its disparate territories, at least temporarily.

During a meeting held in Grand Cayman in June of this year, leaders from the Falklands to Bermuda declared that they would form a united front against any attempts to enforce legislation from Westminster on the territories.

“Modern-day colonialism is what is being attempted by those persons is Westminster, and I am certain that all Overseas Territories will resist it vociferously,” Bermuda Premier David Burt said.

About the same time, the UK Crown Dependencies announced their commitment to public registers in line with developments in the EU, while Gibraltar expressed its intent to introduce a public register before the end of the year.

**Resistance, repercussions**

A high-ranking Cayman government official said they negotiated with other territories for months while arriving at their current position. Other territories argue that their constitutional relationship with the UK prevented them from committing to public registers at this time. For example, the British Virgin Islands is pursuing a legal challenge to the beneficial ownership provision passed by the UK Parliament.

“Nobody is doing anything by subterfuge,” the Cayman official said. “We [territories] are in constant communication with each other on these matters, as well as engaging in discussions with the UK to help arrive at what is best for each individual territory, as well as the BOTs as a whole.”

The official acknowledged there is often a disconnect between the elected politicians in Westminster who set policy, and the civil servants in the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office who deal with the territories.

“The politicians pass legislation according to what they feel will play well in their constituencies, sometimes with little knowledge or concern for how that might impact territories like Cayman. The FCO staff is generally more attuned to, if not sympathetic toward, the territories’ positions, frankly because they know us and talk to us,” the official said.

The senior partner we spoke to said continuing discussions with foreign entities is necessary, but talks are not a substitute for action, both in legal courts and the court of public opinion.
“The consequences of allowing the UK to dictate Cayman’s economic policy are nothing less than the demise of Cayman’s economy,” they said. “Additionally, Cayman must stand firm in its defense of clients’ privacy, which is a foundational component of our financial services sector.”

The other legal professional sees things differently. “Look, both the UK and Cayman recognise that public registers are not just the standard of the future, they are rapidly becoming the standard for the industry right now,” they said. “We have no choice but to evolve, and in my opinion, the consequences of adopting public registers -- if EU countries do as well -- will be minimal.”

### Bermuda ready to ‘get digital’

The Bermudian government is going to accept digital currency as payment for government taxes, fees and services, beginning next year.

Making the announcement at the beginning of the Bermuda Tech Summit this week, Premier David Burt said the move “will establish Bermuda as an example to other jurisdictions on how to adopt and benefit from the advancement of technology around digital currencies”.

Don’t start counting out your bitcoins just yet. Bermuda’s proposal is to allow digital payments, provided they are licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, in the form of ‘stablecoins’, which (like the Bermuda and Cayman dollars, for example) are pegged to the US dollar and derive their value from that fiat currency.

(That doesn’t include the most-well known cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, whose value is determined by the market and are not backed by any ‘real assets’. However, stablecoins are currently being developed by major corporate entities including Facebook and IBM.)

A leader of a blockchain-technology company in Cayman greeted the news from Bermuda as a good step toward further normalising digital currencies and demonstrating their real-world utility. “I wouldn’t describe it as a ‘game-changer’ or anything, but I think it’s a good move by Bermuda, at the very least to broadcast that Bermuda is ready to embrace the fintech sector,” they said.

Bermuda has passed legislation for initial coin offerings and established a regulatory sandbox whereby digital asset companies can launch their services on a limited scale to give supervisory authorities the opportunity to study the best regulatory approach.

Earlier this year, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and Barbados fintech company Bitt Inc. signed a contract to pursue a pilot test of a blockchain-issued Central Bank Digital Currency -- creating a digital version of the EC dollar. As part of the project, the digital dollar will be used for financial transactions via smart phones (with no transaction costs) among merchants and individuals alike.

Pointedly, Bermuda Premier Burt said his jurisdiction isn’t launching its own digital currency.

“For Bermuda the risks of launching our own digital currency outweigh the opportunities,” Burt said.

Bermuda’s initiative is supported by Circle and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which last year launched USD Coin, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. There are currently about US$1 billion of USD Coins in circulation.

Circle is also the first company that obtained a full licence under Bermuda’s Digital Asset Business Act and in July moved its exchange operations to that country.

Circle’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “Bermuda’s Premier made a broader announcement today about embracing stablecoins as the future of the financial system, with a focus on innovations in fintech that can deliver value not just for Bermudians, but also globally via companies licensed under their Digital Asset Business Act.”

Other companies supporting the venture with their stablecoins are Binance with BUSD; TrustToken with TUSD; Stably with USDS; and Hub Culture’s Ven with Ultra USD.

In addition, Burt said, “On the open financial ecosystem front we have the support of Celsius Network, who offer lending services and pay interest on deposits; SALT, the first digital asset lending company and institutional custodian: MAPay a healthcare payments provider; Sablier, a payment solution provider; and Stablehouse, a stablecoin exchange provider.

He also mentioned ConsenSys, whose Codefi payments tool would “make it easy for governments and merchants to accept digital payments”.

### 30,000 problems but a work permit ain’t one

Well, at the very least, frustrated Cayman commuters now know they’re not going crazy: There really are a whole lot more people on the roads than there used to be.

According to Cayman’s workforce authority, there are a record-high 30,298 work permit holders living in Cayman in November, an 11 percent increase compared to the 27,263 work permit holders back in February.

A senior-level manager in a local bank said the growth in work permits mirrors the continued growth in Cayman’s economy. “This is good news, as far as I’m concerned,” they said. “The added population leads to added demand and spending, which generates more wealth for businesses and the country as a whole. All you have to do is look at the strength in real estate sector to see this is driving the economy upward.”

The increase in work permits is somewhat a case of the “usual suspects” -- the growth has been driven by the top countries-of-origin for expats in Cayman, including Jamaica, the Philippines, the UK and India.

Jamaica continues to be the most-represented country for expats, with the number of Jamaican work permit holders increasing by 10 percent to 12,788.

A senior financial services professional from a major firm pointed out that the increase in foreign labor is occuring during a time of extremely low unemployment. Estimates from March and April (released just this week) pegged the overall unemployment rate at 3% and the Caymanian unemployment rate at 4.8%.

Overall, Cayman’s labor force grew by 7.7% in 12 months, while the absolute number of unemployed people declined from 1,464 to 1,407. The same survey estimated the population of Cayman at more than 68,000 people.

The leader of a local recruitment firm said, “The entire economy seems to be thriving. In regard to the number of work permits specifically, I would say the primary driver is in the construction industry. We haven’t seen any sign of the current development boom fading.

“What is uncertain, as of yet, is whether the new economic substance legislation will have a significant impact -- positive or negative -- on the number of financial services employees, and by extension the greater economy,” they said.

“There also is, I wouldn’t say nervousness, but obvious concern over knock-on effects from Brexit and a potential slowing-down in the American economy,” they said.

### UCCI gets budget bailout

Staring down the barrel of major budget deficit, Cayman’s public college was rescued with the promise of a $1.3 million cash infusion from Cabinet.

The funding, which still needs to be cleared by Finance Committee, is intended to cover a 5% cost-of-living adjustment for staff, a new data-management system, and new or replacement faculty and staff positions.

That’s good news for UCCI. Better news, according to UCCI Board chairman Mark Scotland, is that ministry officials have indicated they would approve a larger budget for the coming year.

“We’re thankful for the government helping us,” Scotland said. “We can definitely work with what has been allocated. We can continue to move ahead.”

Before the $1.3 million infusion, UCCI’s annual budget was about $7 million, with $4 million in the form of government subsidy.

One partner at a major financial services firm told us that what UCCI really needs isn’t more money from government, it’s less -- at least, proportionately.

“Over the decades the government has shown itself incapable of or unwilling to adequately support higher education in Cayman. At best, UCCI is treading water. The industry needs young Caymanian accountants, lawyers and support personnel. We shouldn’t have to continue relying on the industry funding scholarships for those young people to study overseas,” they said. “There is no reason Cayman, either via UCCI or elsewhere, shouldn’t have viable tertiary education programs in our key economic areas.

“It is in the best interests of the firms, and the country, for the private sector to step up and become the primary financial supporter of Cayman’s institutions of higher education,” the partner said.

### Constitutional changes OK’d

Premier Alden McLaughlin and Opposition Leader Arden McLean have agreed on changes to the Cayman Islands Constitution that were recently green-lighted by the UK.

Last week, the premier announced the UK was amenable to including a mandatory requirement for consultation on legislation or Orders in Council that would directly impact the Cayman Islands; as well as removing reserve powers from the governor to write legislation, disallow legislation and write standing orders for the Legislative Assembly.

McLean wasn’t OK with every proposal, however. He balked at the governor’s continuing ability to address the Legislative Assembly, and -- perhaps most importantly -- the possible addition of an eight minister to Cayman’s government. McLean thinks having eight ministers in a 19-member assembly would make it that much harder to gather a two-thirds majority needed to depose a premier.

(For the record, prior to 2013, the Legislative Assembly had 15 elected members, with seven being ministers. From 2013-2017, there were 18 elected members, with seven ministers.)

McLean said McLaughlin agreed to postpone the eight-minister provision until after the next election in 2021.

The Premier and Opposition Leader sent off their joint letter to the UK requesting the passage of the Constitution Amendment Order. Hopefully, they used express mail service -- the next UK elections are scheduled for Dec. 12, and there’s no guarantee a new government will accept the changes negotiated with the current government.

### Quotes of the Week

#### McLaughlin, Eden, Chaum, BBC

Premier **Alden McLaughin**, quoted by the *Cayman Compass*: “I do believe, as do my advisors, that by this time next year we will begin to see a significant economic slowdown, not because of anything to do with Cayman but because of the global economy.”

MLA **Anthony Eden**, speaking to Attorney General Samuel Bulgin during the Legislative Assembly session, referring to lawyer Leonardo Raznovich, who has acted as pro bono counsel for an LGBT couple challenging Cayman’s marriage laws: “This individual has been wandering around all over the world; he went to look for the Pope, and different ones. I thought he was here at the pleasure of our people. I didn’t quite understand why in the first hearing he was sitting there with the petitioners, and I don’t know how we can sit down and continue to house someone that has inflicted so much pain on so many of our people in Cayman.”

**David Chaum**, Founder and CEO of Cayman-based fintech firm Praxxis, commenting on the launch of his company’s “quantum-resistant” blockchain, to Blockchain News: “I am thrilled to be able to reveal that we’re working on the Praxxis decentralised digital currency to support high-speed financial transactions. The world also needs Elixxir communication technology, since it is the only known practical way to shred the metadata that is inevitably created as we live our digital lives.”

The **BBC**, in a mea culpa for editing out audience reaction to a question posed to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the importance of people in power telling the truth: “This clip … was shortened for timing reasons on Saturday's lunchtime bulletin, to edit out a repetitious phrase from Boris Johnson. However, in doing so we also edited out laughter from the audience. Although there was absolutely no intention to mislead, we accept this was a mistake on our part, as it didn't reflect the full reaction to Boris Johnson's answer.”

**Tom Scott**, vice president at Eurobank, quipping after his auction bid fell short for the Audi at the Hedge Funds Care gala: “Thank God. I would have had to sell my house to pay for the car.”
